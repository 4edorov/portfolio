          <p>
            I&#39;m Master of Economics and Bachelor of Laws. I have nine years
            expirience in this industries and I worked both in a Public Office and
            Private company.

            But a few years ago I sensed the need for change, my friend advised me
            to try programming. Well, I reminded me of high school and university, it
            was funny to learn to programm in Turbo Pascal 7.0 and I was an &#39;A&#39;
            student in rocket science. Why not?!
          </p>
          <p>
            I started to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The key and important endpoint
            is the start of a learning with the freeCodeCamp community
            in November 2016.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I&#39;m working on a real project as a Web Developer.
            I like it very much and I&#39;m continuously studying new things.
            All actions yields results. It&#39;s awesome!
